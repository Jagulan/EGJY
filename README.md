# Vending machine system 

In this project, I developed a front-end system for a vending machine - Penelope's Pastry Delights, using C++14, emphasizing advanced programming techniques
and good software design principles. The project aimed to simulate the operations of a vending machine selling various pastry treats. 

Skills I have learnt from this project 

- C++14 Features
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Dynamic Memory Management
- File Processing
- Data Validation
- Error Handling
- Valgrind for Memory Leak Detection
- Command Design Pattern
- Modular Design Principles
- Version Control (Git/GitHub)
- Team Collaboration (MS Teams)
- User Interface Design (CLI)
- Memory Leak Prevention
